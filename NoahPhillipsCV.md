##Profile

Though I've received undergraduate and master's degrees in music and working as a professional fronted developer for some 7 years.  The logical and creative problem solving skills involved in writing clean, elegant, and clear code are virtually identical to those of composing and playing written music.  I believe the similarities between music and code are why I was initially drawn to web development and desire to continue exploring new ideas as the web evolves before our very eyes.  In addition I'm quite conversant in many topics and quite jovial while drunk which makes me great at parties and so fourth.

##Recent Works

####Juniper Networks

*front-end developer on [juniper.net](http://www.juniper.net) for [JohnMcneil Studio](http://www.johnmcneilstudio.com)*

* Responsible for building responsive HTML components from PSD files for deadline based hand off to Juniper’s dev team.
* Lead developer during QA as the code base stabilized and matured
* Stack: git, node/npm, grunt, sass, js, [zetzer html templating](https://github.com/brainshave/zetzer), [handlebars](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js)

The first iteration of the site was built using [grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) as our task runner for compiling the js modules, sass modules, and html templates.  We’ve since moved the codebase to a framework called [Fabricator](https://github.com/fbrctr/fabricator) which uses HandleBars for html templating and [glup](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) for taks running and compilation.  [Fabricator](https://github.com/fbrctr/fabricator) includes an auto generated BootStrap like style guide enabling much cleaner and clearer documentation for Juniper's dev team.

####Cleversafe

*front-end developer on [cleversafe.com](https://www.cleversafe.com/) for [JohnMcneil Studio](http://www.johnmcneilstudio.com)*

* Responsible for building responsive HTML components from PSD files for deadline based hand off to Cleversafe's dev team.
* Stack: git, node/npm, [broccoli](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli), sass, js, zetzer [html templating](https://github.com/brainshave/zetzer)

Here we again chose a node and npm development environment in which to build our frame work.  After experiencing a host of drawbacks with [grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) in previous projects we decided to use [broccoli](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli) as our main task runner.  Using broccoli also allowed us to deploy to directly [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for our staging and QA sites without the need to track the output folder with git.

####Wooqer

*front-end developer on [wooqer.com](http://www.wooqer.com/) for [JohnMcneil Studio](http://www.johnmcneilstudio.com)*

* Worked directly with the designer on a 'mobile first' design and implementation
* Stack: git, node/npm, wordpress (PHP, custom fiels, et cetera) sass, js.

The client in this case requested a WordPress site for easy and clear content management.  We built a custom theme from the ground up complete with custom fields and php functionality.  As a developer WordPress is a total drag but for clients it's basically a god's send.
