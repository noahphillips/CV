## Profile

Though I received undergraduate and master's degrees in music, I have worked as a professional fronted developer for some 7 years.  The logical and creative problem solving skills involved in writing clean, elegant and clear code are virtually identical to those of composing and playing written music.  I believe the similarities between music and code are why I was initially drawn to web development and desire to continue exploring new ideas as the web evolves before our very eyes.  In addition, I'm very conversant in many topics and quite jovial while drunk which makes me great at parties and so forth.

## Recent Works

#### John McNeil Studio Limited Edition

*front and back-end developer on [limited edition staging](http://le-grav-test.jmsdevelop.com/) for [John Mcneil Studio](http://www.johnmcneilstudio.com)*

* Front End lead responsible for mark-up, layout, interactive implementation, build tools, task runners and customized CMS
* Stack: git, node/npm, gulp and [laravel mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix), sass, js, [twig html templates](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/), yaml for hooking up the CMS, and working with the SoundCloud SDK and API for use in custom SoundCloud players

This project's objective was to convert a WordPress site into a flat file CMS site using the [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) CMS.  In addition we found that a major cleaning and code refactor was critial to the new build. The first iteration of the site was essentially a custom WordPress theme which primarily relied on advanced custom fields to manage the custom layout and content.  For a number of reasons the site kept crashing and in general was found to be, shall we say, not so robust.  We decided to use the [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) CMS which does not rely on a MySQL DataBase.  The so called ‘flat file’ system turned out to be much faster in the browser and magnitudes easier to develop, maintain and even scale up than the WP version.

#### Caledonia Spirits

*front-end developer on [Caledonia Spirits](http://caledoniaspirits.com/) for [John Mcneil Studio](http://www.johnmcneilstudio.com)*

* Responsible for building responsive HTML components using [Timber templates](https://github.com/timber/timber) for a custom WordPress site.
* Developed CSS animations that were beyond the original designs
* Stack: git, node/npm, gulp and [laravel elixir](https://github.com/laravel/elixir), sass, js, [Timber templates](https://github.com/timber/timber)

We made the decision to use [Timber](https://github.com/timber/timber) for the mark-up templates because it’s a fully realized HTML templating technology built on [twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) and we were all very familiar with it’s many features.  This decision turned out to greatly speed and clean up our entire process ergo allowing us time to focus on all front-end bells and whistles the original designs left out.  The end result was a much richer interactive experience.

#### Trifecta Nutrition

*front-end developer on [Trifecta Nutrition](https://www.trifectanutrition.com/) eCommerce site for [JohnMcneil Studio](http://www.johnmcneilstudio.com)*

* Refactored layout and mark-up for an eCommerce WordPres site built with the [Avada WordPress Theme](https://avada.theme-fusion.com/)
* Stack: git, node/npm, wordpress style php (custom fiels, et al...) css, jQuery.

The client in this case requested a WordPress site for easy and clear content management.  We built a custom theme from the ground up, complete with custom fields and php functionality.  As a developer, WordPress is a total drag, but for clients it's basically a godsend.
