##Profile

Though I've received undergraduate and master's degrees in music I've been working as a professional frontend developer for some 7 years.  The logical and creative problem solving skills involved in writing clean, elegant, and clear code are virtually identical to those of composing and playing written music.  I believe the similarities between music and writing code is why I was initially drawn to web development and desire to continue exploring new ideas as the web evolves before our very eyes.

##Recent Works

####Juniper Networks

*front-end developer on [juniper.net](http://www.juniper.net) for [JohnMcneil Studio](http://www.johnmcneilstudio.com)*

Responsible for building responsive HTML components from PSD files for deadline based hand off to Juniper’s dev team.  After the first phase of this project I became one of the project leads in charge of bug fixing, build hand-offs and continued development.

The first iteration of the site was built using [grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) as our task runner for compiling the js modules, sass modules, and html templates.  We’ve since moved the codebase to a framework called [Fabricator](https://github.com/fbrctr/fabricator) which includes an auto generated BootStrap like style guide enableing much cleaner and clearer documentation for Juniper's dev team.


####Cleversafe

*front-end developer on [cleversafe.com](https://www.cleversafe.com/) for [JohnMcneil Studio](http://www.johnmcneilstudio.com)*

Responsible for working with designers in what was essentially a mobile first redesign of Cleversafe’s site

Here we again chose a node and npm in which to build our frame work.  After experiencing a host of drawbacks with [grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) we decided to use [broccoli](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli) as our main task runner.
