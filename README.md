## Recent Works

#### Maker Share Learning Center

*front-end developer [maker share learning center](https://makershare.com/learning/) for [Make&#58;](https://makermedia.com/)*

* Front-End lead responsible for mark-up, layout, responsive design, user interactions and content data structure
* Stack&#58; git, node/npm, [laravel mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix), sass, ES6, [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), yaml.

The goal was to essentially convert lessons on how to hack hardware from a book into an interactive website.  There was talk of eventually integrating it into the [makershare.com](https://makershare.com) build.  However full integration looked to be much more difficult than originally scoped.  To this end I decided to use Jekyll for HTML templating and YAML for the content data structure.  I'd also planned on using [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) as a Content Management System.  Sadly the project ran out of funding for this piece.

#### CA Technologies Modern Software Factory

*front-end developer [ca modern-software-factory](https://www.ca.com/us/modern-software-factory.html) for [John Mcneil Studio](http://www.johnmcneilstudio.com)*

* Front-End developer responsible for mark-up, layout, responsive design, user interactions and content data structure
* Stack&#58; git, node/npm, [laravel mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix), sass, ES6, [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), yaml.

We were tasked with creating a site that showcased the many facets of CA Technology's software division while also generating demand for their various products.  In addition we had to implement filtering and search on a flat-file data structure.  We ended up going with [lunrjs.com](https://lunrjs.com/) for all the filtering and searching.  In addition we had to help the CA dev team implement [Marketo](https://www.marketo.com/) for all of their lead gathering, et cetera.  The 'card' design work quite nicely as a responsive layout and for the requested image sliders.

#### Caledonia Spirits

*front-end developer on [caledonia spirits](http://caledoniaspirits.com/) for [John Mcneil Studio](http://www.johnmcneilstudio.com)*

* Responsible for building responsive HTML components using [Timber templates](https://github.com/timber/timber) for a custom WordPress site.
* Developed CSS animations that were beyond the original designs
* Stack&#58; git, node/npm, gulp and [laravel elixir](https://github.com/laravel/elixir), sass, js, [Timber templates](https://github.com/timber/timber)

We made the decision to use [Timber](https://github.com/timber/timber) for the mark-up templates because itâ€™s a fully realized HTML templating technology built on [twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) and we were all very familiar with its many features.  This decision turned out to greatly speed and clean up our entire process ergo allowing us time to focus on all front-end bells and whistles the original designs left out.  The end result was a much richer interactive experience.
